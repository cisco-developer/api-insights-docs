# Welcome to the API Insights docs project

The root `config.json` file creates the table of contents. A second "sub config" JSON file is found in `references/clidocs/cli-reference-config.json`. The CLI reference is generated from the CLI source files and should not be edited directly here.

All content is written in Markdown. 

The OpenAPI Specification file for the API Insights API is referenced in the root `config.json` file.
